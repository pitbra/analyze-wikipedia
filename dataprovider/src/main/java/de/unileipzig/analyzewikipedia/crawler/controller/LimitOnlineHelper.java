Over a span of 100 years, he has shown himself to be a hardy trouper, having appeared in 67 plays and revivals. Before you begin wondering why he has never received a lifetime achievement award, you should know that George Spelvin is a fictitious name adopted by actors for various reasons.<br /><br />George Spelvin may be the name used by an actor doubling in another role in the play. Or George Spelvin may be an actor who wants to conceal his identity. (For example, an actor playing the part of a corpse in a play might prefer the anonymity of the name George Spelvin.) In five of the 67 plays in which the name has been used, it has been shown as George Spelvin, Jr. The 1929 play <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kibitzer</span> uses a father-and-son combination: the names of both George Spelvin and George Spelvin, Jr. appear in small parts. The play was written by journalist (and later lyricist) Jo Swerling and Edward G. Robinson, who also played the principal role. Robinson was yet to be a big name; that would come after he played a sensational Capone-like gangster in the 1931 film, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Little Caesar.</span><br /><br />The program of the 1932 play <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">They All Come to Moscow</span>, which marked the Broadway debut of Hollywood actor Cornel Wilde, appropriately carries the name George Spelvinsky playing the part of an officer in the Russian secret police. In the program for the play <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In Any Language</span> that opened in New York’s Cort Theatre on Oct. 7, 1952, and starred Walter Matthau and Eileen Heckart. The play is set in Rome, Italy, and the name George Spelvin appears playfully as Giorgio Spelvino.<br /><br />George Spelvin had a female counterpart, Georgette Spelvin. The female version of the name enjoyed a brief, two-year run of popularity between 1932 and 1934. It appeared in the program of the 1932 play <em>Riddle Me This,</em> starring Thomas Mitchell, and the&nbsp;1934 production of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dodsworth</span>, based on Sinclair Lewis's novel, in which Walter Huston starred. An actress in hard-core adult films, born Dorothy May in Texas in 1936, used the name Georgina Spelvin from 1957 until she retired in 1982 at age 47.<br /><br />Another substitute name that has been popular with actors on Broadway is Walter Plinge. The name has been used to identify an actor in 12 plays on Broadway between 1917 (in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Colonel Newcome</span>, staring Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who died shortly after the play closed) and 1936 (in a revival of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cyrano de Bergerac</span> starring Walter Hampden). The name Walter Plinge was also that of the stage manager of the 1965 play, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">All in Good Time</span>.<br /><br />Hollywood has used the names George Spelvin and Walter Plinge sparingly to conceal the identity of an actor. The name George Spelvin appeared in the credits of only seven films between 1926 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Just Suppose</span>) and 1999 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kiss Toledo Goodbye</span>). The most recognizable George Spelvin was probably Robin Williams, billed by that name in the 1996 film <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Secret Agent,</span> playing the part of the Professor in the film version of the Joseph Conrad novel.<br /><br />Williams had used names other than his own on the credits of several films in the past. In 1988, playing the part of the King of the Moon, he was billed as Ray D. Tutto (which Italian speakers will recognize as \"king of everything\"). As Sudy Nim, Williams supplied the voice of the kiwi in the 1991 TV film, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A Wish for Wings That Work</span>. And in the 1992 film <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Shakes the Clown,</span> Williams, billed as Marty Fromage, played the part of the mime class instructor.<br /><br />The George Spelvin name also appears on the screen credits of directors, writers, cinematographers, composers, editors, art directors, and production designers. The most popular identity-hiding name used in Hollywood, however, is not George Spelvin. That dubious honor goes to director Allen Smithee, a name that was first employed in 1969 on the film, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Death of a Gunfighter, </span>starring Richard Widmark and Lena Horne, and helmed by director Robert Totten.<br /><br />Partway through the film, Widmark locked himself in his trailer and refused to come out. Totten was replaced as director because of \"artistic differences\" with Widmark, who had the reputation of sometimes being difficult to work with. Multi-talented Don Siegel, whose fame had been growing since his 1956 classic film<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Invasion of the Body Snatchers</span> was hired to take over. Siegel had just finished working with Widmark on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Madigan,</span> a 1968 film about a maverick detective. However, the new director shot little more than a new opening and new ending for the troubled film.<br /><br />With filming concluded, Siegel, uneasy because Totten had actually directed more of the film than he had, refused to take screen credit as did Totten. Instead of using his name, Siegel suggested that the director's name be shown as Al Smith. After the Directors Guild of America discovered that there already was a listed director of that name, Siegel suggested an alteration of the name Al Smith--Allen Smithee. A precedent was set for directors who did not want their names on a film. The name has several variants: Alan Smithee, Alan Smythee, Adam Smithee.<br /><br />\"I'm sorry I got involved in the making of the picture,\" Siegel said later. \"I thought Totten made a mistake in taking his name off the credits when I did, as he was truly the director of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Death of a Gunfighter</span>.\" The picture was released on May 9, 1969. To everyone's surprise, it found favor with critics and the public alike. In Chicago, Roger Ebert wrote, \"Director Allen Smithee, a name I am not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally. He never preaches, and he never lingers on the obvious. His characters do what they have to do.\" He added an opinion that must have pleased Robert Totten: \"This is one of Richard Widmark's best, most fully realized performances.\" Critic Howard Thompson, reviewing the film in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The New York Times</span>, wrote, \"the film has been sharply directed by Allen Smithee.\"<br /><br />Allen Smithee, with its variant Alan Smithee, turned out to be an all-purpose name. Hollywood is not known for its modesty, but between 1969 and 1997, the Smithee name was also used to conceal the identities of 34 directors, 29 actors, 28 writers, 28 film producers, 22 miscellaneous crew members, 10 second-unit directors and 5 cinematographers. In addition, the name served to hide the identities of assorted production designers and managers, art directors, artists and other specialized crafts.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Death of a Gunfighter</span> lost the doubtful honor of being the first Allen Smithee film when two films that had gone into production in 1968 were credited to him retroactively. One was titled <em>I</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ron Cowboy</span> (also known as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fade In</span>) that marked the first starring role for actor Burt Reynolds. The other film retroactively ascribed to Allen Smithee was <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Omega Imperativ</span>e.<br /><br />After 28 years and 33 Smithee-directed films on the record books, director Arthur Hiller's cut of his 1997 biting film about the movie colony was rejected by the production company that had bankrolled it. An unhappy Hiller suggested that his name be removed from the film, which was eventually titled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn.</span> It was intended to be the last film to bear that all-purpose director's name: The Directors Guild effectively put an end to the name game--at least for directors--simply by delisting the fictitious Allen/Alan Smithee as a director.<br /><br />The Smithee name proved to be hard to kill. It still turns up on films that have been edited for TV or for showings on airplanes when creative types associated with the film, such as script writers, have wanted to distance themselves from the truncated version.</span><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"></span></span><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em\"></div><p class=\"blogger-labels\">Labels: <a rel='tag' href=\"http://notorc.blogspot.com/search/label/Actors%27%20Stage%20Names\">Actors' Stage Names</a>, <a rel='tag' href=\"http://notorc.blogspot.com/search/label/Theater%20Lore\">Theater Lore</a></p><div class=\"byline\">Posted by Notorc&nbsp;@&nbsp;<a href=\"http://notorc.blogspot.de/2006/06/almost-famous-spelvins-plinges-and.html\" title=\"permanent link\">6/12/2006 11:45:00 AM</a> <span class=\"item-action\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/email-post.g?blogID=27825934&postID=115012733014887311\" title=\"Email Post\"><img class=\"icon-action\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://img2.blogblog.com/img/icon18_email.gif\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"/></a></span><span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-287631015\"><a style=\"border:none;\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=27825934&postID=115012733014887311&from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\"><img class=\"icon-action\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://img2.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"></a></span> </div><!-- AddThis Bookmark Post Button BEGIN --><div><a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?pub=rossta&url=http://notorc.blogspot.de/2006/06/almost-famous-spelvins-plinges-and.html&title=Almost Famous: The Spelvins, the Plinges and the Smithees\" title=\"Bookmark using any bookmark manager!\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.addme.com/images/button1-bm.gif\" width=\"125\" height=\"16\" border=\"0\" alt=\"AddThis Social Bookmark Button\" /></a></div><!-- AddThis Bookmark Post Button END --><p /></div><hr><div class=\"blogComments\"><a name=\"comments\"></a>Comments: <a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=27825934&postID=115012733014887311\">Post a Comment</a> | <a href=\"http://notorc.blogspot.de/\">Postscripts</a> Homepage    </div><!-- 	In accordance to the Blogger terms of service, please leave this button somewhere on your blogger-powered page.

She hires Nero Wolfe to discover the identity of the the infant's mother and during the course of the investigation she and Archie find themselves increasingly attracted to each other. One of the clues he finds is an unusual handmade horsehair button, but when he tracks down the craftswoman who made it, she is uncooperative and soon after is found strangled. When Wolfe orders his operatives to set up a sting in Washington Square Park using the baby as bait, the operation finally bears fruit.                <em class=\"nobr\">Written by<a href=\"/search/title?plot_author=Gabe%20Taverney%20%28duke1029%40aol.com%29&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=tt_stry_pl\">Gabe Taverney (duke1029@aol.com)</a></em>            </p>        </div>                <span class=\"see-more inline\">                 <a href=\"/title/tt0394811/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl\">Plot Summary</a>    <span>|</span>        <a href=\"/title/tt0394811/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl\">Add Synopsis</a>    </span>        <hr />        <div class=\"see-more inline canwrap\" itemprop=\"keywords\">            <h4 class=\"inline\">Plot Keywords:</h4><a href=\"/keyword/novelist?ref_=tt_stry_kw\"> <span class=\"itemprop\" itemprop=\"keywords\">novelist</span></a>                        <span>|</span><a href=\"/keyword/button?ref_=tt_stry_kw\"> <span class=\"itemprop\" itemprop=\"keywords\">button</span></a>                        <span>|</span><a href=\"/keyword/abandoned-baby?ref_=tt_stry_kw\"> <span class=\"itemprop\" itemprop=\"keywords\">abandoned baby</span></a>                        <span>|</span><a href=\"/keyword/writer?ref_=tt_stry_kw\"> <span class=\"itemprop\" itemprop=\"keywords\">writer</span></a>                        <span>|</span><a href=\"/keyword/teddy-bear?ref_=tt_stry_kw\"> <span class=\"itemprop\" itemprop=\"keywords\">teddy bear</span></a>            <span>|</span>&nbsp;<nobr><a href=\"/title/tt0394811/keywords?ref_=tt_stry_kw\">See All (23)</a>&nbsp;&raquo;</nobr>        </div>              <hr />        <div class=\"see-more inline canwrap\" itemprop=\"genre\">            <h4 class=\"inline\">Genres:</h4><a href=\"/genre/Action?ref_=tt_stry_gnr\"> Action</a>&nbsp;<span>|</span><a href=\"/genre/Drama?ref_=tt_stry_gnr\"> Drama</a>&nbsp;<span>|</span><a href=\"/genre/Mystery?ref_=tt_stry_gnr\"> Mystery</a>        </div>                           <hr/>        <div class=\"txt-block\">        <h4 class=\"inline\">Parents Guide:</h4>        <span class=\"see-more inline\" itemprop=\"audience\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Audience\"><a href=\"/title/tt0394811/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg\"> Add content advisory for parents</a>&nbsp;&raquo;

He said that his 18 year old son did an interview for a documentary recently and said OLD 37 was his favorite movie his Dad (Kane) ever made. That is some high praise before a screening. <br /><br />Kane also went on to praise the team he worked with and talked about his time working with Bill Moseley. <br /><br />What an honor!<br /><br />Then we got to watch it and it delivered, a lot. I got there early and had a chair and the room fit about 500 people and it was full. People were sitting on the floor to watch this movie. Everyone cheered at the end but I wont spoil anything. <br /><br />This film was awesome. Really great kills but mostly a great story. Not something you see in horror everyday. It was also shot really pretty. A step above your average horror. I was able to bring my teenage daughter with me and she really liked it as well. We bought t-shirts and Kane signed them! <br /><br />We cannot wait to get the DVD.

After a falling out with his timber magnate father, a young man heads for Alaska ostensibly looking for gold. Along the way he befriends a mistreated dog and is befriended by a mistrustful indian. After many adventures the pair lay claim to an abandoned gold mine and this is where the young man finally realizes the underlying reasons for his journey to the far north. Much of this film is corny and unrealistic, however, it is still an entertaining hour and a half. The Canadian landscape is lush and beautiful. </p>                    </div>                </span>                <hr />                <div class=\"yn\" id=\"ynd_319480\">                    17 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;                    Was this review helpful to you?                    <button class=\"btn small\" value=\"Yes\" name=\"ynb_319480_yes\" onclick=\"CS.TMD.user_review_vote(319480, 'tt0106506', 'yes');\" >Yes</button>                    <button class=\"btn small\" value=\"No\" name=\"ynb_319480_no\" onclick=\"CS.TMD.user_review_vote(319480, 'tt0106506', 'no');\" >No</button>                </div>            <div class=\"see-more\">                                <a href=\"/title/tt0106506/reviews-enter?ref_=tt_urv\"rel=\"login\">Review this title</a>                <span>|</span>                    <a href=\"/title/tt0106506/reviews?ref_=tt_urv\">See all 2 user reviews</a>&nbsp;&raquo;            </div>        </div>    </div>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleUserReviewsWidget_finished');    }  </script>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleUserReviewsWidget_finished');    }  </script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet(\"be\", \"TitleUserReviewsWidget\", {wb: 1});    }</script><script>    if (typeof uex == 'function') {      uex(\"ld\", \"TitleUserReviewsWidget\", {wb: 1});    }</script>                          <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleContributeWidget_started');    }  </script>    <div class=\"article contribute\">        <div class=\"rightcornerlink\"><a href=\"https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/contribution-information/adding-data/G6BXD2JFDCCETUF4?ref_=cons_tt_cn_gs_hlp\">Getting Started</a>            <span>|</span><a href=\"/czone/?ref_=tt_cn_cz\">Contributor Zone</a>&nbsp;&raquo;</div>        <h2>Contribute to This Page</h2>                <div class=\"button-box\">                    <form method=\"get\" action=\"https://contribute.imdb.com/updates\">                        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref_\" value=\"tt_cn_edt\" />                        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"edit\" value=\"legacy/title/tt0106506/\" />                            <button class=\"btn primary large\" rel=\"login\" type=\"submit\">Edit page</button>                    </form>                </div>        <div class=\"button-box\"><a href=\"/title/tt0106506/reviews-enter?ref_=tt_cn_urv\"class=\"btn large\" rel=\"login\">Write review</a>        </div>    </div>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleContributeWidget_finished');    }  </script>                <a name=\"slot_center-20\"></a>        <div class=\"article\">                                                                    <script type=\"text/javascript\">if(typeof uet === 'function'){uet('bb','NinjaWidget',{wb:1});}</script>                                                                <span class=\"ab_widget\">                <div class=\"ab_ninja\"><span class=\"widget_header\"> <span class=\"oneline\"> <a href=\"/list/ls025849840/videoplayer/vi297515033?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=3411382382&pf_rd_r=17H75W4NZ70YZ6CKG395&pf_rd_s=center-20&pf_rd_t=15021&pf_rd_i=tt0106506&ref_=tt_vd_is_vodshow%2B4_hd\" > <h3>The Movies the <i>Roman J.

He is versatile. He is prolific. And he doesn&#39;t exist. From 1969 until 1999, Allen Smithee was the pseudonym adopted by Hollywood directors when they wished not to be associated with films ostensibly of their making . Encompassing over fifty films of various stripes -- B movies, sequels, music videos, made-for-TV movies -- Smithee&#39;s three decades of work affords the authors of this volume a unique opportunity to reassess the claims of auteurism, both in its traditional guise and in the more commodified form it currently assumes.Sometimes treating Smithee as an auteur in much the same way critics and scholars have treated directors as diverse as Douglas Sirk, Abbas Kiarostami, and Quentin Tarantino, the contributors reclaim new possibilities for auteurist filmmaking and film studies, even as they show what an empty display it has recently become. In accounting for this change, the essays in this volume employ innovative theories of authorship to recapture the subversive effect that auteurism once enjoyed. Thus the Smithee name becomes part of a larger discussion of the economics and history of pseudonyms in filmmaking -- notably in the blacklist of the 1950s -- as well as an opportunity to employ Jacques Derrida&#39;s theory of the signature to recover obscured economic and historic contexts within Smithee&#39;s films.Unique in its focus, innovative in its approach, Directed by Allen Smithee argues that it is precisely through throwaway films such as Smithee&#39;s that recent Hollywood cinema can best be studied.\"/><meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Directed by Allen Smithee\"/><meta

Smithee specializes in the mediocre. He is versatile. He is prolific. And he doesn't exist. From 1969 until 1999, Allen Smithee was the pseudonym adopted by Hollywood directors when they wished not to be associated with films ostensibly of their making . Encompassing over fifty films of various stripes -- B movies, sequels, music videos, made-for-TV movies -- Smithee's three decades of work affords the authors of this volume a unique opportunity to reassess the claims of auteurism, both in its traditional guise and in the more commodified form it currently assumes.Sometimes treating Smithee as an auteur in much the same way critics and scholars have treated directors as diverse as Douglas Sirk, Abbas Kiarostami, and Quentin Tarantino, the contributors reclaim new possibilities for auteurist filmmaking and film studies, even as they show what an empty display it has recently become. In accounting for this change, the essays in this volume employ innovative theories of authorship to recapture the subversive effect that auteurism once enjoyed. Thus the Smithee name becomes part of a larger discussion of the economics and history of pseudonyms in filmmaking -- notably in the blacklist of the 1950s -- as well as an opportunity to employ Jacques Derrida's theory of the signature to recover obscured economic and historic contexts within Smithee's films.Unique in its focus, innovative in its approach, Directed by Allen Smithee argues that it is precisely through throwaway films such as Smithee's that recent Hollywood cinema can best be studied.\",\"my_library_url\":\"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\\u0026continue=https://books.google.de/books%3Fop%3Dlibrary%26hl%3Dde\\u0026hl=de\",\"is_magazine\":false,\"is_public_domain\":false},{\"enableUserFeedbackUI\":true,\"pseudocontinuous\":true,\"is_cobrand\":false,\"sign_in_url\":\"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\\u0026continue=https://books.google.de/books%3Fid%3DbhF3-AqlWIcC%26pg%3DPA102%26redir_esc%3Dy%26hl%3Dde\\u0026hl=de\"},{\"page\":[{\"pid\":\"PA102\",\"flags\":8,\"order\":123}]},null,null,{});</script><script type=\"text/javascript\">var _gaq = _gaq || [];_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-18010-1']);_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);(function() {var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

His problem isn't illness or old age, some say, but screenwriter Joe Eszterhas.</p><p>Smithee is the pseudonym slapped on a film when a director demands that his own name be removed from the credits. Since his invention by the Directors Guild in 1968, Smithee has showed up on dozens of films and TV shows, from an episode of \"Twilight Zone\" to the airline version of Martin Brest's \"Scent of a Woman.\" Within the industry, Smithee's name has been a signal that something went awry. But to most Americans, for years, Smithee was just another show-biz auteur.</p><p>Then, Eszterhas made \"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn,\" a documentary-style satire of the movie biz that--while it was a box-office dud--got lots of buzz on the Internet, prompted national press accounts and introduced the masses to Smithee. (The movie's conceit, as one amateur reviewer explained on the Ain't It Cool News movie Web site, is that a director named Alan Smithee wants his name off a picture \"but the catch is, the name the DGA puts on in place of disgruntled directors' names is Alan Smithee.\")</p></div></div><div class=\"float\" style=\"clear:both;height:1px;line-height:1px;\"><img src=\"/images/pixel.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></div><div id=\"mod-ctr-lt-in-top\" class=\"mod-latarticlesadcpc mod-adcpc with-fourth-cpc\"><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var adSkipCounter = 0; </script><iframe id=\"mod-ctr-lt-in-top-frame\" src='javascript:(function() {document.open();document.write(\"<style>body{margin:0px;}</style><script>google_ad_client=\\\"ca-pub-8415620659137418\\\";google_ad_slot=\\\"6929940680\\\";google_ad_width=\\\"649\\\";google_ad_height=\\\"160\\\";google_ad_channel=\\\"8847325881,1000001856,1000000001\\\";google_adtest=\\\"off\\\";google_safe=\\\"high\\\";google_hints=\\\"alan smithee smithee alan smith board of directors dga\\\";google_max_num_ads=\\\"2\\\";google_override_format=true;google_page_url=\\\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271\\\";</script><script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\\\"></script>\");document.close();})();' frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"649\" height=\"160\"></iframe></div><div id=\"mod-a-body-after-first-para\" class=\"mod-latarticlesarticletextwithadcpc mod-latarticlesarticletext mod-articletext\"><p>Ever since Disney released the film, in 1998, Smithee's reputation has suffered, with movie studios worrying that crediting him is tantamount to labeling a movie damaged goods. But this week came the first hard evidence that Smithee's days are numbered.</p><p>MGM's \"Supernova,\" which opened Friday, was directed by Walter Hill, who subsequently petitioned the DGA to have his name removed. Normally, this would be Smithee's moment to shine. Instead, Hill, the production company and the DGA agreed to a different pseudonym: Thomas Lee. And that raised the question: Where was Smithee?</p><p>The answer, according to one DGA board member: Smithee has taken sick and is unlikely to recover.</p><p>\"I have a fondness for the fellow. I gave birth to him. But Eszterhas ruined it,\" said veteran director John Rich, a member of the DGA board of directors since 1953 who helped coin the Smithee name. \"Several on the board feel we should maintain Smithee. But I understand the view of the majority that he's been damaged to the point that it's unworkable. This is an ideal time for his obituary.\"</p><p>Writer-director Gary Ross (\"Pleasantville\") said Smithee should die happy because \"considering he has such a body of undistinguished work, it's amazing he has had such a long career.\"</p><p>The DGA does not comment on particular credit disputes, and it requires directors who remove their names to refrain from talking about the films they've disowned. Officials at MGM declined comment as well (the film wasn't screened for critics and will be reviewed in The Times on Monday). And Eszterhas did not return repeated phone calls last week.</p><p>But throughout the industry, Smithee's failing health has prompted talk about not just credit battles but also the changing relationship between Hollywood and the consumer.</p><p>Eszterhas' Smithee project aside, moviegoers today know more about the inner workings of the movie business than ever before. Fueled by numerous nightly televised entertainment news shows and Internet sites that report on movies even as they're being made, fans can recite box-office statistics and report on the results of private test screenings. In this atmosphere, many said, it was only a matter of time before Alan Smithee was exposed as a cipher.</p><p>\"It used to be an inside-baseball, inside-Hollywood name known just to people in the business. It was a way of indicating that a director had been unhappy with the process,\" said one insider who said discussions about Smithee's fate are \"ongoing\" at the DGA. \"Given the baggage that Smithee has now, the question is whether his name will ever be agreeable again.\"</p><p>Many suspect that the answer is no.</p><p>\"If MGM has broken the Alan Smithee barrier, I can't see why any other studio would put it on again,\" said one writer-director who was surprised that the DGA would give up the Smithee label--which was intended as an incentive to encourage studios not to change directors' work. \"The DGA has set a precedent.\"</p></div><div id=\"mod-a-body-after-first-para-ad-cpc\" class=\"mod-adcpc\"><iframe id=\"mod-a-body-after-first-para-ad-cpc-frame\" src='javascript:(function() {document.open();document.write(\"<style>body{margin:0px;}</style><script>google_ad_client=\\\"ca-pub-8415620659137418\\\";google_ad_slot=\\\"6929940680\\\";google_ad_width=\\\"649\\\";google_ad_height=\\\"110\\\";google_ad_channel=\\\"8847325881,1000001856,1000000001\\\";google_adtest=\\\"off\\\";google_safe=\\\"high\\\";google_hints=\\\"alan smithee smithee alan smith board of directors dga\\\";google_max_num_ads=\\\"2\\\";google_override_format=true;google_page_url=\\\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271\\\";</script><script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\\\"></script>\");document.close();})();' frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"649\" height=\"110\"></iframe></div><div class=\"float\" style=\"clear:both;height:1px;line-height:1px;\"><img src=\"/images/pixel.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></div><div id=\"mod-a-body-after-second-para\" class=\"mod-latarticlesarticletextwithadcpc mod-latarticlesarticletext mod-articletext\"><p>Former Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President Arthur Hiller, meanwhile, said Smithee's death, if it comes, will be an honorable one.</p><p>\"Either way, Alan Smithee has served his purpose,\" Hiller said, \"drawing the movie audience's attention to the fact that production companies in some cases have taken over a director's film and changed the whole intent.\"</p><p>Smithee was born after the DGA found itself swamped suddenly with requests from unhappy directors who wanted to distance themselves from what they viewed as botched work.

The behaviour of characters, the reaction of the other folks...I will say that is a social drama, a drama in which many folks can identify in. French film industry is prolific in this kind of topics too. This said, I don&#x27;t explain why this interesting TV movie has not been signed by the actual director&#x27;s name. Why Allan Smithee? A name usually used for products which are not recognized, films which the directors are ashamed of? I don&#x27;t understand. That a movie about a woman fight to defend herself against a prick, an ass hole who is her manager. Perfect TV movie story. I like it, and the acting is more than convincing too.</p>                    </div>                </span>                <hr />                <div class=\"yn\" id=\"ynd_3571408\">                    1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;                    Was this review helpful to you?                    <button class=\"btn small\" value=\"Yes\" name=\"ynb_3571408_yes\" onclick=\"CS.TMD.user_review_vote(3571408, 'tt0080769', 'yes');\" >Yes</button>                    <button class=\"btn small\" value=\"No\" name=\"ynb_3571408_no\" onclick=\"CS.TMD.user_review_vote(3571408, 'tt0080769', 'no');\" >No</button>                </div>            <div class=\"see-more\">                                <a href=\"/title/tt0080769/reviews-enter?ref_=tt_urv\"rel=\"login\">Review this title</a>                <span>|</span>                    <a href=\"/title/tt0080769/reviews?ref_=tt_urv\">See one user review</a>&nbsp;&raquo;            </div>        </div>    </div>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleUserReviewsWidget_finished');    }  </script>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleUserReviewsWidget_finished');    }  </script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet(\"be\", \"TitleUserReviewsWidget\", {wb: 1});    }</script><script>    if (typeof uex == 'function') {      uex(\"ld\", \"TitleUserReviewsWidget\", {wb: 1});    }</script>                          <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleContributeWidget_started');    }  </script>    <div class=\"article contribute\">        <div class=\"rightcornerlink\"><a href=\"https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/contribution-information/adding-data/G6BXD2JFDCCETUF4?ref_=cons_tt_cn_gs_hlp\">Getting Started</a>            <span>|</span><a href=\"/czone/?ref_=tt_cn_cz\">Contributor Zone</a>&nbsp;&raquo;</div>        <h2>Contribute to This Page</h2>                <div class=\"button-box\">                    <form method=\"get\" action=\"https://contribute.imdb.com/updates\">                        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref_\" value=\"tt_cn_edt\" />                        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"edit\" value=\"legacy/title/tt0080769/\" />                            <button class=\"btn primary large\" rel=\"login\" type=\"submit\">Edit page</button>                    </form>                </div>        <div class=\"button-box\"><a href=\"/title/tt0080769/reviews-enter?ref_=tt_cn_urv\"class=\"btn large\" rel=\"login\">Write review</a>        </div>    </div>  <script>    if ('csm' in window) {      csm.measure('csm_TitleContributeWidget_finished');    }  </script>                <a name=\"slot_center-20\"></a>        <div class=\"article\">                                                                    <script type=\"text/javascript\">if(typeof uet === 'function'){uet('bb','NinjaWidget',{wb:1});}</script>                                                                <span class=\"ab_widget\">                <div class=\"ab_ninja\"><span class=\"widget_header\"> <span class=\"oneline\"> <a href=\"/list/ls025849840/videoplayer/vi297515033?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=3411382382&pf_rd_r=041ND4WRZRJ6YPH0ZHAE&pf_rd_s=center-20&pf_rd_t=15021&pf_rd_i=tt0080769&ref_=tt_vd_is_vodshow%2B4_hd\" > <h3>The Movies the <i>Roman J.

Aldrich Award for extraordinary service to the Directors Guild of America has been bestowed on many fine directors whose selflessness and talents certainly reflect the award's namesake. But rarely has an award been appreciated so personally than by this year's recipient, former Guild president Jud Taylor.<br>																<p>Taylor received his initiation into film as an actor in Aldrich's 1956 film <i>Attack</i>!</p>																<p>The following year, the fiercely independent Aldrich re-hired Taylor for <i>The Garment Jungle</i>, from which the director was eventually fired in midstream, giving both future DGA presidents, Aldrich and Taylor, primary lessons in the need for a powerful union that would back its members in disputes with studios and producers and defend their creative rights. During their presidencies, the Guild made strides that strengthened both needs into maxims.</p>																<p>\"I thought that Bob Aldrich was always an extraordinary guy, dedicated, loyal, professional &#151; a guy who cared a great deal for his actors and treated them especially well,\" Taylor said. \"It was a pleasure to know him. I was a very good friend of Bob's and he was a mentor in many ways.</p>																<p>\"To me, even though I have won a DGA Award (for <i>Foxfire</i> in 1988) and been nominated for Emmys, this award takes on greater importance, because of my relationship with Bob,\" Taylor said. \"The Guild's negotiations in 1973 and 1981 were under his aegis. He was very supportive of me and probably had a great deal to do with my being elected president.</p>																<p>\"Bob was very influential in the direction of the Guild. He was bright, very aggressive, and he cared a great deal. He started as an assistant director, and he always stuck up for the assistant directors. He was totally devoted to the Guild. When it came to negotiations, he gave his all.\"</p>																<p>Taylor served as president from 1981 to 1983, succeeding George Schaefer as the second central leader of the Guild to come from television's ranks. Prior to Schaefer, the Guild's presidency had been filled by feature directors including Aldrich, Frank Capra and George Sidney.</p>																<p>\"George Schaefer clearly broke the differentiation line between feature and TV directors,\" Taylor said. \"I was aware that I was a TV guy who was in the Guild's top position, but in terms of the Guild's supportiveness at all times for both feature and TV directors &#151; it was always there.\"</p>																<p>Taylor joined the Guild in 1964 when his continuing acting role on <i>Dr. Kildaire</i> led to his ability to express interest in directing the show. Once a member, his interest in the Guild led him to attend meetings of the Directors Council and the DGA's National Board.</p>																<p>\"I used to sit in on these meetings, listen to the nature of the problems &#151; political and otherwise. I found it fascinating,\" Taylor said. \"After a few years, I was elected a delegate to the National Board, and then served on the National Board for four terms. I was looking for something challenging beyond the TV work. Directing was challenging, but the DGA offered me a different kind of stimulation in seeing how contracts and disputes were dealt with.\"</p>																<p>Taylor served two terms as a second vice president of the Guild &#151; one under Aldrich and one under Schaefer &#151; and looked into how the Guild's pension plans were being managed in the mid-1970s.</p>																<p>\"I went to Bob and said, 'This plan is not doing particularly well,'\" Taylor remembered. \"He said, 'Well, talk to some investment advisors.' I did and that led us to making a marketing report to the National Board. That led to us going to the trustees of the plan, and telling them that we weren't doing as well as other pension plans. That led to a change in our investment manager and contributed to my chairing of the negotiations in 1980 and election to the presidency.\"</p>																<p>Taylor admits that serving as Guild President can mean a scaling back in directing work. \"Serving the Guild takes time, energy and devotion away from your directing career,\" Taylor said. \"However, it's very important. You just do it. The hard part is that you sacrifice time at home with your family, but you also know that term will conclude.\"</p>																<p>Taylor felt that one of the important achievements of his presidency was negotiating a formula for pay-TV directors at a time when upstart HBO sued the Guild on anti-trust charges (the Guild prevailed), and increasing the Guild's awareness of equal opportunity for minorities and women.</p>																<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cool gridx=\"16\" gridy=\"16\" showgridx showgridy width=\"158\" height=\"107\" bgcolor=\"#ffcc33\" align=\"right\">																	<tr height=\"3\">																		<td width=\"3\" height=\"106\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"3\" height=\"106\"></td>																		<td width=\"154\" height=\"3\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"154\" height=\"3\"></td>																		<td width=\"1\" height=\"3\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"1\" height=\"3\"></td>																	</tr>																	<tr height=\"103\">																		<td width=\"154\" height=\"103\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" xpos=\"3\"><a href=\"images/features_mar03/foxfire_full.html?0108052\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/web/20081121011911im_/http://www.dga.org/news/v27_6/images/features_mar03/foxfire.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Jud Taylor on the set of &quot;Foxfire&quot; - click image for larger view\"></a></td>																		<td width=\"1\" height=\"103\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"1\" height=\"103\"></td>																	</tr>																	<tr height=\"1\" cntrlrow>																		<td width=\"3\" height=\"1\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\"></td>																		<td width=\"154\" height=\"1\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"154\" height=\"1\"></td>																		<td width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></td>																	</tr>																</table>																The veteran of more than 40 made-for-TV movies, Taylor was nominated for an Emmy Award for directing <i>Tail-Gunner Joe</i> (1977), a fact-based historical drama about the life of Sen. Joe McCarthy, played by Peter Boyle. Taylor's other TV movies include <i>Hawkins on Murder</i> (1973) with James Stewart, <i>Broken Vows</i> (1987) with Tommy Lee Jones, <i>Great Escape II: The Untold Story</i> (1988) with Christopher Reeve (Taylor acted in the 1963 original feature directed by John Sturges) and <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> (1990) with Anthony Quinn. In 1983, Taylor was president of production for Columbia Pictures, but returned to TV after a year.																<p>Taylor twice used the general Guild pseudonym Alan Smithee, for the TV movies <i>Fade-In </i>(1968) with Burt Reynolds and <i>City in Fear</i> (1980) with David Janssen. \"I had a couple of problem in my career having to do with editing and not having the contractually required number of days in the editing room that my agent couldn't resolve,\" Taylor said. \"So, I went to the Guild and said, 'This is what's going on.' The Guild went to bat for me. I got Alan Smithee on them both. It was a signal to the industry from a creative rights point of view that the shows had been tampered with.\"</p>															</blockquote>														</div>														<div align=\"right\">															<blockquote>																<p><b><i>&#150;Jerry Roberts<br>																		</i></b></p>															</blockquote>														</div>													</td>												</tr>												<tr>													<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#fffacd\"><img src=\"/web/20081121011911im_/http://www.dga.org/news/mag_images/standard/spacer.gif\" width=\"63\" height=\"10\" border=\"0\"></td>												</tr>												<tr>													<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">														<div align=\"center\">															<blockquote>																<a href=\"#top\"><b>top of page																		<hr>																	</b></a></blockquote>														</div>													</td>												</tr>												<tr>													<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ccffff\"><img src=\"/web/20081121011911im_/http://www.dga.org/news/mag_images/standard/spacer.gif\" width=\"63\" height=\"10\" border=\"0\"></td>												</tr>												<tr>													<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ccffff\">														<blockquote>															<b><u>Related Items:</u></b>															<ul>																<li><b><a href=\"news_awardsnoms.php3\">55th Annual DGA Award Nominees</a><br>																	</b>																<li><b><a href=\"feat_scorsese_laa.php3\">Martin Scorsese</a></b> - <i>Lifetime Achievement Award</i><br>																<li><b><a href=\"feat_rich_lma.php3\">John Rich</a></b> - <i>Honorary Life Member</i><br>																<li><b><a href=\"feat_yudi_capra.php3\">Yudi Bennett</a></b> -<i>Frank Capra Achievement Award<br>																	</i>																<li><b><a href=\"feat_candy_schaffner.php3\">Esperanza &quot;Candy&quot; Martinez</a></b> - <i>Franklin J.

Von 1968 bis 2000 wurde es von der [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) für solche Situationen empfohlen, seither ist es '''Thomas Lee'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Angeles Times|latimes]].com: [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271 ''Name of Director Smithee Isn't What It Used to Be''], zuletzt geprüft am 2. April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alan Smithee'' ist jedoch weiterhin in Gebrauch.Alternative Schreibweisen sind unter anderem die Ursprungsvariante ''Al&lt;u&gt;len&lt;/u&gt; Smithee'' sowie ''Alan Sm&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt;thee'' und ''A&lt;u&gt;dam&lt;/u&gt; Smithee''. Auch zwei teilweise asiatisch anmutende Schreibweisen ''Alan Smi Thee'' und ''Sumishii Aran'' gehören – so die [[Internet Movie Database]] – dazu.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/ Eigener Eintrag für ''Alan Smithee'' in der IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;== Geschichte ===== Entstehung ===Das Pseudonym entstand 1968 infolge der Arbeiten am Western-Film ''Death of a Gunfighter'' (deutscher Titel ''[[Frank Patch – Deine Stunden sind gezählt]]''). Regisseur [[Robert Totten]] und Hauptdarsteller [[Richard Widmark]] gerieten in einen Streit, woraufhin [[Don Siegel]] als neuer Regisseur eingesetzt wurde.Der Film trug nach Abschluss der Arbeiten noch deutlich Tottens [[Manier (Stil)|Handschrift]], der auch mehr Drehtage als Siegel daran gearbeitet hatte, weshalb dieser die Nennung seines Namens als Regisseur ablehnte. Totten selbst lehnte aber ebenfalls ab. Als Lösung wurde  ''Allen Smithee'' als ein möglichst einzigartiger Name gewählt (bei der späteren Variante ''Alan Smithee'' war das [[Anagramm]] ''The Alias Men'' vermutlich kein Entstehungsgrund).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/bio ''Biography for Alan Smithee''] in der Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;In den zeitgenössischen Kritiken wurde der Regisseur u.&amp;nbsp;a. von [[Roger Ebert]] mit den Worten gelobt: {{Zitat-en|Director Allen Smithee, a name I’m not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally. He never preaches, and he never lingers on the obvious. His characters do what they have to do.&lt;ref&gt;rogerebert.[[Chicago Sun-Times|suntimes]].com: [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19690512/REVIEWS/905120301/1023 ''Death of a Gunfighter''], zuletzt geprüft am 2. April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;|Übersetzung=Regisseur Alan Smithee, ein Name, der mir nicht vertraut ist, erlaubt es seiner Handlung, sich natürlich zu entfalten. Er predigt niemals, und er verweilt nie beim Offensichtlichen. Seine Charaktere tun, was sie tun müssen.}}=== Aufdeckung und Abkehr ===1997 kam die Parodie ''An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' (deutscher Titel ''[[Fahr zur Hölle Hollywood]]'') in die Kinos, was das Pseudonym einem größeren Publikum bekannt machte, nicht zuletzt weil [[Arthur Hiller (Regisseur)|Arthur Hiller]], der eigentliche Regisseur des Films, selbst seinen Namen zurückzog und analog zum Filmtitel das Pseudonym ''Alan Smithee'' benutzte. Der Film gilt als einer der schlechtesten Filme der 1990er Jahre und gewann fünf [[Goldene Himbeere]]n.Der Film ''[[Supernova (2000)|Supernova]]'' ist der erste Post-Smithee-Film, dort führte ein gewisser ''Thomas Lee'' alias [[Walter Hill]] die Regie.&lt;!-- fand nur einen für den von 1990, siehe ''[[Das Kindermädchen]]'':„Smithee wurde allerdings auch nach ''Supernova'' gesichtet, in einem Film namens ''The Guardian''.“--&gt;== Verwendung ==Die Verwendung dieses oder eines anderen Pseudonyms ist für Mitglieder der DGA streng reglementiert. Ein Regisseur, der für einen von ihm gedrehten Film seinen Namen nicht hergeben möchte, hat nach Sichtung des fertigen Films drei Tage Zeit, anzuzeigen, dass er ein Pseudonym verwenden möchte. Der Rat der DGA entscheidet binnen zwei Tagen über das Anliegen. Erhebt die Produktionsfirma Einspruch, entscheidet ein Komitee aus Mitgliedern der DGA und der Vereinigung der Film- und Fernsehproduzenten, ob der Regisseur ein Pseudonym angeben darf. Über die Beantragung muss der Regisseur Stillschweigen halten, ebenso darf er den fertigen Film nicht öffentlich kritisieren, wenn die DGA ihm die Verwendung eines Pseudonyms zugesteht.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe zu diesen Regelungen [http://www.dga.org/~/media/Files/Contracts/Agreements/2008%20BA/008ba2008article8.pdf Artikel 8, Abschnitt 8-211 des ''Basic Agreement''] (PDF; 125&amp;nbsp;kB) der DGA von 2008, abgerufen am 25. April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ein Antrag des Regisseurs auf Pseudonymisierung kann abgelehnt werden, so durfte [[Tony Kaye (Regisseur)|Tony Kaye]] den Namen Smithee bei dem Film ''[[American History X]]'' nicht einsetzen, obwohl er den Antrag stellte.Auch bei nicht-US-amerikanischen Produktionen wird der Name verwendet, wie etwa beim [[Pilotfilm]] der Fernsehserie ''[[Schulmädchen (Fernsehserie)|Schulmädchen]]''. 2007 sendete die ARD am 8. und 9. August den zweiteiligen TV-Film ''Paparazzo''. Auch in diesem Werk erscheint anstatt des eigentlichen Regisseurs [[Stephan Wagner (Regisseur)|Stephan Wagner]] Alan Smithee im Abspann.Regisseure, die das Pseudonym benutzt haben:* [[Don Siegel]] und [[Robert Totten]] (für ''[[Frank Patch – Deine Stunden sind gezählt]]'')* [[David Lynch]] (für die dreistündige Fernsehfassung von ''[[Der Wüstenplanet (Film)|Der Wüstenplanet]]'')* [[Chris Christensen]] (''The Omega Imperative'')* [[Stuart Rosenberg]] (für ''Let’s Get Harry'')* [[Richard C.
